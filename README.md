RAG for Legal Question Answering and Summarization
This project explores the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering Indian constitutional legal queries. The architecture combines semantic retrieval and generative modeling to ensure accurate, context-aware responses grounded in authoritative legal texts.

📄 Project Overview
Objective:
Develop a question-answering system that retrieves relevant legal content (from the Indian Constitution) and generates precise, contextually appropriate answers.

Key Features:

Retrieval of relevant articles using dense embeddings (Sentence Transformers)
Answer generation using Qwen-3 4B language model
User authentication (login/signup)
Query history tracking
Responsive frontend for ease of use
Technologies Used:

Backend: Python (Flask), MongoDB, FAISS
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
LLM: Qwen-3 4B
Embedding Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Deployment: Google Colab + Ngrok, Frontend hosted on Netlify/GitHub Pages
🏛️ Architecture
The system is structured into three layers:

Frontend Tier: User interface (login/signup, query input, answer display).
Backend Tier: API logic, authentication, retrieval pipeline.
Model Tier: Retriever (FAISS) and Qwen-based answer generator.
💡 How it Works
User Query: User submits a legal question via the frontend.
Retrieval: The system retrieves the most relevant constitutional text chunks using embeddings.
Generation: Qwen-3 4B generates a contextually relevant answer based on the retrieved passages.
Response: The answer is displayed to the user, along with references to the source articles.
